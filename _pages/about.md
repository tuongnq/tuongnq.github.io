Hi, I am Tuong and an Electrical Engineer. I love electronic stuffs and running.

Currently, I am doing a master of engineering degree in Australia.

I am a highly experienced high-voltage test engineer who has been involved in testing, commissioning, and maintaining electricity substations up to 500 kV for over six years. My main areas of expertise include diagnostic measurement, project management, and power distribution. My goal is to maximize productivity and the quality of electrical testing.
